# OS Security Log Dashboard

This project provides a dashboard for displaying OS security logs in real-time, with visualizations and filtering options for the logs based on severity and category. The frontend of this project uses React, and the backend utilizes WebSocket communication (Socket.io) to stream the logs to the dashboard.

## Features:
- Real-time log updates via WebSockets.
- Logs can be filtered by severity (Critical, Warning, Normal).
- Log data is visualized using charts.
- Modern and interactive user interface built with React and Material UI.

## Prerequisites:
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Backend server running** (Socket.io) - You'll need to connect this frontend to a live backend or run your own backend server for real-time log updates.
